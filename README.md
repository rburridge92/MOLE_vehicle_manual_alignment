# MOLE Vehicle Manual Alignement
##Introduction
This code is a manually driven guidance system for vehicle alginment over and underground underbody charger.
The code aims to convert surround cameras into a 360 BEV, detect the presences of a charger and track and visualise the charger to the driver as it moves underneath the vehicle. 

Also provided is a calibration file for setting up the BEV and stitching transformation matrices needed for the 360 view. 


##Camera Calibration
For further information on the calibration process please refer to it's individual [README file](https://github.com/rburridge92/MOLE_vehicle_manual_alignment/tree/main/src/BEV_Calibration)
